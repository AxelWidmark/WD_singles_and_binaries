# WD_singles_and_binaries

This project is under construction.

It is about inferring properties of the local population of white dwarfs (WDs) and identifying single WD and binary WD systems, using astrometric and photometric information from Gaia and SDSS.

With this code, it is possible to identify hundreds of objects which are high confidence WD binaries in the solar neighbourhood.
